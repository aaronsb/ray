; Embedded Torus - Frisvad et al. 2014 Figure 13 test case
; Glass box with glass torus inside for photon differential caustics testing

; Materials
(material glass (type glass) (rgb 0.98 0.98 1.0) (ior 1.5))

; Sun from above-side angle to create caustic pattern
(sun (azimuth 45) (elevation 60) (intensity 1.2) (color 1.0 0.98 0.95) (ambient 0.01))

; Gray floor to see caustics clearly
(material floor-mat (type diffuse) (rgb 0.7 0.7 0.7))
(floor (y 0) floor-mat)

; Glass box: 2x2x2 units, centered at height 3.0 (bottom at y=2.0)
; Raised higher to allow caustics to spread and show pattern
(shape (box (at 0 3.0 0) (half 1.0 1.0 1.0)) glass)

; Glass torus inside the box
; Major radius 0.6, minor radius 0.25, rotated to lie flat (horizontal)
(shape (torus (at 0 3.0 0) (R 0.6) (r 0.25) (rotate 90 0 0)) glass)
